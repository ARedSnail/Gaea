# Modifiers

**Modifiers** are similar to those in software like Blender. You add these to your GeneratorSettings, and they get applied after the generation is finished, giving you varied results and possibilities. 

There are a few modifiers in Gaea at the moment:

### Generate Borders

Generate border tiles around already placed tiles.

### Carver

Carves holes into the map using a noise texture.

### Smooth
