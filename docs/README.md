# 🌍 Gaea

Gaea is an **add-on for Godot 4**, designed to empower your project with advanced **procedural generation** capabilities.

> **NOTE:** Gaea is currently in early development, and may not yet be optimized for larger, more complex projects. Stay tuned for ongoing improvements and enhancements!

### What's in a Name?

Gaea, in Greek mythology, is the personification of Earth - a nod towards the terrain and world generation capabilities this addon brings to your game development toolkit. Plus, we think it sounds pretty cool.
